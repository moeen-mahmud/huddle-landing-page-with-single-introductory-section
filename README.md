## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5 markup
- CSS BEM
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - For font styles
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - For Icons

### What I learned

In this project I learn how to align font awesome icons as they are not optimized also I try to implement BEM method. This is a good excersice for layout. The css properties for the icons shown below:

```css
.footer_icons--state {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  color: var(--neutral-white);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  width: 3rem;
  height: 3rem;
  margin-right: 2rem;
  border: 1px solid var(--neutral-white);
  border-radius: 50%;
  padding: 1rem;
  transition: all 0.4s ease;
}
```

### Continued Development

By finishing this challenge, I complete all the "newbie" challenges. Look forward to complete the junior challenges and so on.
